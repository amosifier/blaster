## *Currently in development*
# Blaster Game
Don't expect this to be a full on game, I still need to add stuff lol

### List of stuff I want to add:

Singleplayer:
Change reload SFX
Better title screen
Regen every 7 seconds 5 HP (not more than 100 HP)

Multiplayer:
Fast blaster - 20 HP Constant
Small blaster - 40 HP 0m - every meter 5 HP less
Precision blaster - 100 HP Constant
Asks you for username each time you spawn (in title screen)
Player movement interpolation
When the server “wakes up”, say “finding server”
Ping display
Death screen
Make a character (make it update by crouching etc…)
Map seed is stored server side

Bugs:
Game goes down to 30 FPS for no reason (only goes back by pausing and rejoining)
